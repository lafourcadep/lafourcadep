## About me

I am a computational physicist specializing in the mechanical response of crystalline materials under extreme conditions, including high strain rates and shock loading. I am currently a researcher at the Laboratory for Matter in Extreme Conditions ([LMCE](https://www-lmce.cea.fr)), a CEA entity located in Bruyères-le-Châtel, France.

A significant part of my current work is devoted to the development of the open-source molecular dynamics (MD) code **exaStamp**, available on [GitHub {{< fa brands github size=lg >}}](https://github.com/Collab4exaNBody/exaStamp), along with its corresponding [documentation {{< fa book size=lg >}}](https://collab4exanbody.github.io/doc_exaStamp).
